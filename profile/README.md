  <strong>Browser-Based Smart Contract IDE for Stacks</strong><br/>
  Zero-setup Clarity development for the Stacks ecosystem.
</div>

---

## 🚀 Overview

LabSTX is an open-source, browser-based development environment for writing, compiling, deploying, and interacting with Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

The goal of LabSTX is to reduce onboarding friction for developers by providing a seamless, zero-installation IDE experience similar to Remix (Ethereum), but built specifically for Clarity and Stacks.

# 💰 Budget Breakdown Summary

Total Requested: **$9,000 USD**

| Phase | Focus Area | Percentage | Amount (USD) |
|-------|------------|------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | Core Stabilization | 25% | $2,250 |
| Phase 2 | ABI & Debugging Enhancements | 35% | $3,150 |
| Phase 3 | Documentation & Education | 40% | $3,600 |

# 🛠 Current Implemented Features

LabSTX already includes:

- Browser-based Clarity code editor
- Syntax highlighting
- Contract compilation
- Contract deployment
- Initial contract interaction panel
- Live hosted version

The current focus is on improving stability, expanding ABI interaction, and formalizing documentation.

---

# 🔐 Security & Scope

LabSTX:

- Does not custody user funds
- Does not store private keys
- Does not manage user assets
- Operates purely as a development interface

This reduces security and regulatory risk.

---

# 🎯 Ecosystem Goals

By the end of the grant period, LabSTX aims to achieve:

- 500+ monthly active sessions
- 1,000+ contract compilations per month
- 200+ deployments (testnet + mainnet)
- At least 3 community contributors

The long-term goal is to strengthen Stacks developer tooling and reduce onboarding friction for Clarity developers.
